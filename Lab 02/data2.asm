;Description: This program uses branches to determine the absolute value of a number 
;as well as determining its sign. By doing so it uses the branch operations that include
;n, z, and p. These branch conditions are for negative, zero and positive values. Using 
;branches it is demonstrated how they work by even placing branches at the bottom of the
;file before the actual HALT operation. This program uses branches to determine if a number
;absolute value was computed correctly which it is reflected in the output of the program.
